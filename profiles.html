            <h3>JOHNSON</h3>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Johnson Nguyen I am a proud student at RMIT city campus. My student ID is 3943851 and my email address is s3943851@student.rmit.edu.au. I come from a line of Vietnamese immigrants and can fluently speak the language. An interesting fact that many may not know about me is that one of my personal greatest achievements is obtaining a 160kg deadlift in the gym which was over double my body weight being only 78kg at the time. I have also recently completed Elden Ring and now have endeavoured onto Sekiro again. IT originally was not my main interest, as it belonged to business where I planned to get into commerce. However, after many months of pondering and research I had realised IT was a much more lucrative field and the work to social life balance was much greater with higher employment. I have always had great interest in technology however, lacked great industry experience.

            <h3>LISA</h3>
            <p>I am Lisa! I am an Asian Australian who was born and raised in Melbourne. Currently I am a full time first year student at RMIT studying a Bachelor of Information Technology and am also working part time on the side. I am a mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese, and am fully fluent in speaking, reading and writing in Vietnamese, but unfortunately cannot for the life of me speak or understand Chinese. I am usually quite busy trying to balance work and university, however when I do find spare time, I usually spend it playing games or doing something creative. I enjoy art and love making and fixing clothes, partially because nothing fits me, but also because I find mending things quite therapeutic. I also spend a lot of my time going out with my friends, and particularly this year, I have been trying to explore new things and creating new memories plus experiences. I love being outdoors, but I also really love my PC set up, so I spend a lot of time at home as well.

              <h3> Natural Language processing and chatterbots </h3>
              <p>Natural language processing is computer programs or artificial intelligence, used in chatterbots (chatbots). They are used in the IT industry to communicate with users through textual or auditory methods. NLP (natural language processing) are commonly defined as the application of computational techniques used for the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech. They are generally used to help other technologies better comprehend complete human language and enable the program to communicate back to users and can be often used in technologies such as AI and chatterbots. With this technology, chatterbots can be able to apprehend language such as a person’s sarcasm, humour or tone, by analysing a person and grasping an idea of the user’s personality, allowing the program to respond accordingly. This program is integrated with chatterbots, which is a software application used to perform online conversations through text–to-speech or speech instead of directing users to live human support. With the interaction of the two technologies, they are able to create a function which can interact with human languages and create a conversion through speech or text-to-speech. Common examples of these chatterbots are Duolingo and Siri, which both have NLP technologies integrated in them.
              </p>
              <p>There have been multiple advancements for NLPs lately as the tech industry continues to grow. Some of which include transfer learning, which is the ability to utilise the information and technology from one platform to another platform instead of having the program relearn the whole content from scratch. Or the ability to use ‘low-code’ tools in order to create NLPs. These were always available, but are coming more to surface in 2022, to create easier access to people who want to use NLPs but have less knowledge on coding. There have also been a lot more advancements on the linguistics of NLPs, where more data from other languages have been inputted more, generating programs with higher intel on the form of human languages. Particularly after the Covid situation, NLPs have also been used to monitor social media and give companies and businesses more of an insight on their customer’s engagement by detecting negative comments. With this, brands are able to counter the comments and make improvements on their own products. Furthermore, social media platforms such as Instagram or even gaming platforms like Riot have been utilising NLPs in order to assess and detect cyberbullying happening around the app communities and censor or ban these acts. 
              </p>
              <p>As NLPs become more advanced and further upgraded as more information and data is being transferred to technological interfaces. There have been future plans of social media platforms and other user interactive platforms that involve chats, to be more regulated. This is again where NLPs will be ascending in the technology sector, as it will be used to detect more explicit and negative content. By doing so, NLPs will be able to censor any content that may interfere with a user’s wellbeing. Through NLPs businesses are also able to collect data and analyse the latest trends by finding out the most commonly searched categories. Because NLPs are one of the most growing industries, it has also become one of the largest fields of data science and will continue to grow as the demand on automation increases. Future advancements of this technology will soon replace live human online support as NLPs collate more intel of the human language and be able to comprehend it more efficiently. 
              </p>
              <p>
              As technology that people claim as the ‘future of communication’ chatterbots will be advancing more into the future. They have been able to integrate more AI, machine learning and NLP technology into their system which has been making comprehension between system and humans easier, effective and accurate. Through the advancements of NLPs there will also be a significant change in the ways chatterbots communicate with people, as it is interconnected with NLPs. There will be more data for these chatterbots to use and chats between bots and humans will most likely become more efficient and human-like, instead of people having a sense that they are communicating with a program. Advancements of the chatterbots themselves are the payments through live chats, such as on social media or gaming platforms, which will be more utilised in the year 2022 and the other years to come. Overall, as other integration technology improves, like AI and NLPs, so will chatterbots because of the combination of these programs.
            </p>
            <p>
            The development of these two software will eventually produce a more convenient and efficient way for customers as well as businesses. These technologies will be able to cut down the time that it usually takes for customers to reach out to businesses for support, as it would be automated by the programs. It has also been able to communicate with people all around the world because of the abundance of data that it has created which includes different languages, enabling most of NLPs to be multilingual. It would also reduce the time that customer support would be needed by a live person, which would also allow support workers to have more time doing other tasks for the businesses, therefore the ‘talk-to-human’ function will also eventually become useless. While this does improve the efficiency of businesses with communicating with customers, it also has some drawbacks. People who may work in ‘talk-to-human’ support may eventually lose their position, whether that is online marketing, sales through mobiles, or customer support, all these tasks can eventually be overtaken by NLP integrated chatterbots as they continue to progress. For example, Alexa and Google assistant have already begun taking over the need of most human support. However, a solution to the reduction of these jobs is to create another job which allows people to gather more language data for these systems to store and comprehend. Another downside to the advancements of these technologies, is the potential of less secure information. As more data is being exposed onto the internet and creating a bigger digital footprint, more data is also vulnerable. Which could create issues concerning security. That being said, from this, more cybersecurity-based industries are able to further grow, to counter this and generate a safer online environment regarding user’s information, therefore also creating more work opportunities. 
          </p>
            <p>
            These advancements made in chatterbot and NLPs will create a more efficient way of interacting with online platforms, whether that is gaming, shopping or social media. Soon chatterbots will rely less on the ‘talk-to-human’ function and be able to communicate to people with ease, without the need of assistance and less confusion. It will be able to broaden its range of decision-making skills and also learn from all the information gathered, helping it grow as it learns. As for people like me, who are pursuing information technology, this technology will open up lots of opportunities for us. Due to its ongoing growth, there will also be possibilities for the industry surrounding it to grow too, whether it's to maintain the system or create better and cleaner versions. This also opens up other external job opportunities, such as occupations regarding the cloud to store more of the input information, or cyber security related jobs, which will take care of the vulnerable information and maintain the privacy of users. Other than industry related, it will also create a safer environment online, such as on social media or gaming. Particularly in gaming, it will be able to detect negative behaviour, filter out toxic players, and create a more enjoyable and safer online gaming environment. Personally, it will also reduce the amount of time I spend trying to contact customer services and waiting for an email reply. With NLPs and chatterbots, queries and concerns will be automatic as the responses will not need to be from a live human, creating more efficiency. However, with, I will also need to create a more secure way of inputting and storing my information, by creating more clouds or backup spaces as well as making sure I have secure passwords. This will also apply to my friends and family, as they will be using this technology more, they will also need to create a more secure way to store their online information. These advancements may also be quite difficult for some of my friends, as they work in the human live support area. The online support could possibly reduce the amount of work for live support workers as they rely more on modern technology. Other than that, having NLP integrated chatterbots in my opinion, would definitely create a more efficient way for online platforms to communicate with their users, making platforms not only faster for businesses, but also make the processes more enjoyable for users, especially because of the fast-paced culture we all live in today.

              <h3>Clouds, services, servers</h3>
              <p>‘The cloud’ is defined as the delivery of servers and their access over computing services, and the program that runs on these servers. It is the transportation of on demand computing services, which businesses can use and pay as they go, rather than maintaining their services on their own system like on a hard disk. Cloud computing is the practice of using these ‘clouds’ and allows companies to rent access to anything a cloud service provider offers instead of having to create their own computing infrastructure or data centres. It also reduces the need of having to contain a lot of data storage in the company for their user’s datas, but instead clouds have their own ‘server storages’ that stores and maintains a business’s information, and in some cases in which data may be lost, clouds are able to have a fast data recovery. Cloud computing itself can be separated into two different models: deployment and service models. Common examples of cloud computing can be: Dropbox or Google App Engine. 
               </p>
               <p>
               Whilst the cloud has been introduced for quite a few decades now, it is still ongoing and rising by each day as technology itself advances. According to ‘Nitanix’, as of right now, the cloud computing market is predicted to double from its present market to $947 billion by 2026. Currently one of the latest states of this rising technology is integrating other programs into the cloud. This could be in the form of Cloud AI or intelligent SaaS, which incorporates artificial intelligence or machine learning into the cloud’s systems. By combining artificial intelligence in cloud computing, users are able to experience the unity of saved data through the projection of AI. In other words, AI is able to connect to users in a better way, with the information in the clouds. Another new trend is the ‘serverless clouds’. While they are still quite new in the tech industry, they have been quite popular amongst large companies such as microsoft or amazon. Based on a ‘Forbes’ article, these ‘serverless clouds’ are clouds that enable businesses to pay as they go, requiring them to pay for only what they need rather than paying fixed amounts. This program allows developers to use applications without the need of managing servers, so therefore there are still servers in the program, but they are eliminated in the app development process.
             </p>
             <p>Cloud computing has a very promising future and is said to definitely continue to develop further. Within the next 3 years, we are expected to see more artificial intelligence seep into cloud computing, but more so cloud security. With this users will be able to have AI tools incorporated into their stored data, such as image recognition or are able to analyse data for insights. Creating more efficiency within the clouds operations and also further benefiting the users. There will also be a rising of the ‘multi-cloud’, which is two or more clouds that are under the same ecosystem generally used to prevent users from relying too much on a single cloud. By doing this clouds are able to increase in stability because of the distributed information. Other than that, there is also a rise in ‘confidential computing’ and ‘hybrid clouds’.
             </p>
             <p>
             Technological advancements that will aid the rise of cloud computing is definitely the improvement and new developments of artificial intelligence and security. Growth of AI technology will definitely play a role in transforming companies by reducing adoption costs but also introducing innovation into their programs and systems. Furthermore, improvements of AI will be able to help cloud security by analysing and diagnosing data, it is also able to control the data, which overall allows the cloud to detect anything that may be an outlier in the cloud. The developments of cybersecurity will also impact cloud services, and create a safer and more secure system, especially with all the content that is being uploaded day by day onto the system. 
           </p>
           <p>
             The advancement of cloud computing will definitely upgrade companies and businesses' systems in the long run as everything around the world becomes more digital based. Firstly in businesses, cloud computing will allow them to expand and extend without having the need to purchase or create their own servers. Allowing not only reduced costs, but also efficiency as it would prevent the need to constantly maintain the servers, as the clouds provide that service. This ensures that businesses are able to worry less about the data that is being imputed, as cloud computing is usually secure, but most importantly they have reliable data recovery and backup, so businesses will be able to benefit from the rise of this technology in the long run. With the future advancements companies will also be able to utilise the services of the AI tools throughout their system, particularly with data diagnoses. This will indicate to them and give them insights on the activities of their users, enabling them to take action into improving the companies itself, by taking into account the data in the cloud. Slowly more and more companies will also start transferring to hybrid and multi-clouds to ensure more secure and less overwhelmed servers, as the data will be able to be distributed into different servers, but still being able to be under the same ecosystem. However, because these clouds are not personally owned by companies, it is also vulnerable and can potentially have risks of attacks. Which is the reason why most clouds are aiming to create better security within the next few years, to create a better environment for businesses and their data. As for its impact on work, cloud security has more positive impact on the work environment than negative. With the need to improve the cloud system, there would be a need for more employees instead of less, creating more employment opportunities instead of the other way around. 
           </p>
           <p>
           Just like any other computing advancements, cloud computing will have a lot of impact on everyone today, especially because of the expansion of technological dependency. Because of my personal interest in the IT industry, the elevation of cloud computing will definitely open up more opportunities and career options for me, especially for someone who is learning about it. There is also so much I can research about for the future of this technology as it is new and has so much flexibility in the things that can be incorporated into it. With the use of this technology, there will be many chances for me to develop better products surrounding this system, as it has so much room for growth, now and in the future. Particularly for me as a student, cloud computing is also cost effective and allows me to save multiple documents in different applications, without worrying about the impact it will have on my harddrive storage. They can also be easily accessed and also creates a more mordernised learning environment for me as a student, especially in IT where there is a lot of software that needs to be used. As for the use of it, I will rest assured knowing that the system is improving day by day particularly in the security of the programs. Cloud computing will be overall more efficient and fast to use, and as time goes on, it will also be a lot faster to use, which can allow non tech savvy people to also use cloud products. In retrospect, cloud computing has come a long way and now allows use to store information in a more secure way. With the implementation of AI in the future, it will also be able to detect any unnecessary content in our storage spaces such as Gmail, allowing us to access our information anywhere.

              <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
              <p>Machine learning as the name implies is where a machine or computer reviews and looks at vast amounts of data and patterns that a human may be able to comprehend and which utilising that data to complete its designated task more efficiently. Furthermore, machine learning is only a subfield to AI as AI has many fields and is only the general time.  Examples of machine learning may come in the form of your emails. A machine is tasked to determine whether an email is considered spam email or not. The current state of this new technology is that unlike before machine learning has become more accessible across multiple industries, however as the technology is still in heavy development is not cheap. The introduction of machine learning has allowed industries to reduce human error and labour during tasks and extract patterns from large amounts of data. There are many different implementations of machine learning such as personalised shopping where the computer will discover patterns and provide recommendations, greater effective warehouse management where the computer may provide the optimal route during the picking phase, and one of the most technical forms of machine learning comes in the form of the automotive industry. Companies such as Tesla have been trying to perfect its AI for their automatic driving cars. This is done through sensors surrounding the vehicle where it’s the computer’s role to pick up patterns and follow road safety regulations. Many are sceptical that in the next 3 to 5 years that machine learning may become more intelligent than mankind, replacing many jobs for with computers. However, machine learning is also a benefit to humanity, for example software is being developed to decipher ancient text at greater speeds and efficiency opposed to a human. Furthermore, machine learning comes in 4 main forms supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is the simplest form of machine learning, it I involve providing a computer a set of labelled data on how to do a human task. Unsupervised learning is where a computer is provided with data that is unlabelled of which it must extract unknown patterns or information. There are many ways in which this is done one of which is principal component analysis (PCA) where the computer reviews a data set and summarises it to later create more accurate predictions. Moreover, semi-supervised is where a machine is provided both labelled and unlabelled data to perform its tasks. The machine utilises the labelled data to understand the scope of the task to then interpret the unlabelled data. Lastly there is reinforcement learning where a machine will observe its surroundings and environment to identify what actions will allow for the lowest levels of risks or maximise its rewards. Most notably reinforcement is used commonly today within smart automatic vacuums. This is where the vacuum will scan its surroundings and ensures that it doesn’t bump into a wall or table etc. Although, machine learning is only the broader category of algorithms. There is another branch of machine learning known as deep learning. Deep learning takes everything from machine learning and moves it further and beyond machine learning capabilities. Typically, a person should only choose the deep learning algorithm over a reinforcement algorithm when they have sufficient high-quality data or when a person is willing to go further with another set of work after to further and more greatly understand what the system if doing.  The machine learning industry is expected to grow from $8.34 billion as of 2019 to $117.19 billion in 2027.  A technical break through which will hopefully shape the future comes within quantum computing which enables computers to process data faster. It may also improve how well the computer reviews data and obtain superior insights. Which should aid businesses further gaining better results than normal machine learning.
               </p>
               <p>
               Machine learning like any other revolutionary technological breakthrough will greatly advance humanity in everyday life and how many businesses will operate, especially with quantum computing progressively getting better at an exponential rate. Furthermore, the development of machine learning will save lives. This form of machine learning application is done through radiology practices. This new medical imaging technology has the potential to analyse more data sets and extract features that humans may not be able to do. Machine learning has many possibilities on what it may become mostly beneficial. However, many industries are at risk of being replaced by machine learning of which even doctors are at risk. Most notably jobs that are currently at the most risk of being replaced by machine learning are customer service call centres, factory workers and warehouse workers. Most modern-day companies already heavily rely on computers to answer FAQ through the phone or on their website already. Warehouse workers and factory workers are also severely at risk of getting replaced by machines learning. As machines can work faster and more efficiently than humans many warehouse owners may wish to opt for machines instead of human labour to cut down on cost. This can be seen with amazon slowly implementing more robots within their warehouses during the picking process. However, machine learning could change the way we drive our cars forever by not driving them. This may allow for everyone to drive within a self-driving car for a low cost. According to the Department of Transportation in the US 94% of driving accidents are due to human error, self-driven vehicles would decrease that statistically drastically and driving accidents would also decrease. Although, doctors too are not safe to change to new technologies. Many robots have been already implemented to perform minor surgeries although with assistance.  Soon this technology will be advanced enough to be administered by itself to a patient to perform intricate surgery.
             </p>
             <p>
             Personally, for myself it would not affect my daily life immediately. As I am also fortunate to be undertaking a STEM course specifically IT my risks of my future careers being replaced by machine learning or computers is slim. As I may be developing the machine learning algorithm myself. However, alongside with my studies I work part time at a warehouse and so does my dad. Our risk of being replaced within the next 5 years is great although, hopefully by then I have completed my course. Moreover, my daily life may be improved with many automated machineries in the future within my own household such as automatic mopping, vacuuming, washing and drying. Although within the present day I like many utilise machine learning everyday whether it be through shopping, browsing the internet or watching shows machine learning is consistently in my life and it would be a great inconvenience without it.  My mother is a nail technician which in hindsight may be a field that is easy to replace with machines, however many may still prefer the human element in getting their nails done over efficient machines. With the advancements of technology my two younger brothers who are both in year 7 may wish to also pursue a career in technology in the near future as it is currently the most sustainable, high demand and great job security. Machine learning is all around me in my everyday life whether I notice it or not. It is present within my usage of the internet; it is also there when I drive my car. Although with greater iterations of machine learning through medical break throughs I may not and hopefully will never experience it. Although many of my family members have chronic pain in their backs and legs which hopefully will be solved with modern medicine or surgeries that may not have been possible before until now.

          <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
          <p>cybersecurity is a job that requires protecting individuals, businesses or company's systems, networks, and programs from attacks against criminals or unauthorised use of electronic data. It is designed to protect all categories of data from theft and damage, these damages include sensitive, personally identifiable information, protected health information, personal information, intellectual property, data, and governmental and industry information systems. These cyberattacks are usually aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information to extort money from users, business, or Companys. Without a cybersecurity program in place, an organisation would not be able to defend itself against breaches this leads to a captivating for cybercriminals. These cyber-attacks could be a malware, where it uses malicious software such as ransomware, spyware, viruses, and worms. Malwares can happen when a user clicks on a malicious link or attachment, which would then install dangerous software. Emotet is another cyber-attack that is developed in the form of a banking trojan. Emotet is currently the costliest destructive malware. Alternatively, Password attacks is common as many inexperienced users who are not good with technology tend to have weak passwords as it can be easily remembered for them. SQL injection is a form of cyberattack as it inserts malicious code into a server that uses a structured query language. phishing uses fake communications such as an email, to trick the receiver into opening it and carrying out the instructions inside. The goal of phishing is to steal sensitive data such as credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine. Furthermore, Cybersecurity is divided into various categories to help focus on a certain cyberattack. These categories consist of network security, the practice of securing a computer and networks from intruders, applications security, the focus on keeping software and devices free of threats, information security, which protects the integrity and privacy of data, operational security, the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets, disaster recovery and business continuity, it defines how an organisation responds to a cyber security incident or any other events that causes the loss of operation or data, and lastly end-user education, it addresses the most unpredictable cybersecurity factor where people can accidentally get a virus to a secure system. With the increase rate of cyberattacks due to the covid 19 pandemic, the demand for the job has risen. It Is estimated that the cybersecurity market will employ around 1 million employees by 2025. The International Data Corporation predicts that the spending on cybersecurity around the work will reach $174.7 billion in 2024. According to GlobaldData, a leader in data and analytics, has predicted that the cyber industry has spent $8.92 billion in 2021 for cyber insurance market and it is predicted that it will more than double to $20.6 billion in 2025. Moreover, In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has produced a cyber-security framework to fight the increase of malicious code and aid in early detection. Technologies that made cyber security possible are artificial intelligence & deep learning, which has two-factor authentication, it works by confirming a user’s identity based on 2-3 parameters. Embedded hardware authentication, this implements a PIN and password to verify the identity. Blockchain cybersecurity is one of the latest cyber security technologies, it works on the bases of identification between the two transaction parties. Zero-Trust Model is based on a consideration that a network is already compromised.
          </p>
          <p>
          Cybersecurity is important to society because it protects all categories of data from theft and damage. With the increase amount of cybercrimes happening, these attacks can damage a business’ reputation and lose the trust of their customers. This leads to loss of customers, loss of sales and the reduction of profits. To protect an organisation against cybercrime, the organisation would require educating the staff how to protect themselves from the web, teaching them what to look out for when going through searches or even emails. Organisations and businesses should set up a security system to manage the incoming and outgoing traffic. Encrypting data can help protect valuable information as the Encryption converts the data into a secret code before it is sent over the internet. Encryption can reduce the risk of theft, destructions, or tempering. All individuals, business and organisations can be affected by cyberattacks; however, organisations are most likely to be affected as cybercriminals know that they have the most money. These criminals may just try and ruin their reputation and leaking information, leading them to lose customer. According to joboutlook, the future growth of cybersecurity is extraordinarily strong as technology is advancing so as cybercriminals. The cybersecurity will expand and grow with more categories of securities.
        </p>
        <p>
        With the Covid 19 pandemic happening, the rise of people using their phones and devices has created more attention to cyber criminals as there are now more vulnerable people. These people may be unaware of these malicious activities that cyber criminals are able to do to steal information. This information can be robbed due to people being uneducated about cyber criminals, leading them to download or clicking random links. Elderly users are an easy target for cyber criminals as many are beginning to use a mobile phone, while unaware of the dangers that are on the web. Formally, I have not encountered any cyberattacks for myself throughout my daily life. If I ever come across a cyberattack on my devices. The criminal could take control over my devices, leading them to take my personal information such as bank details, emails, and passwords. After doing this research about cybersecurity and cyberattacks, I am now cautious of what I do on the web, such as looking at email making sure not to click on an attachment or link that could lead to a malicious virus. I would change my password making it more complex having it long, more numbers and special characters so then it would be difficult for an individual to guess and have access to my account. Constantly updating my devices as, it every time an update there is usually a new security update to stop more malicious malwares or viruses. I would highly advise my friends and family to download an antivirus and antimalware software and having a security system to block the threats, essentially having a firewall. Some antivirus and antimalware software's that I advise would be McAfee Antivirus and Norton Antivirus. These software can be on any devices that a user may have. Finally, having a fully updated devices helps reduce the risk, due to many devices have security updates. Security updates happens to ensure that if there is any new malicious or breaches, the updated would be able to notice it and stop it.

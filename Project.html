              <h1>Project Idea</h1>
                <p>
                  The project idea chosen is a sort of mobile app which can generate outfit ideas for someone with the clothes that they already have. This app would be designed in the style of a sort of customisable game, where users can modify how their character looks to replicate how they look as well. It would be a more in-depth character customisation compared to other ‘dress up’ games as it would need to mirror what the user looks like so that the user themselves are able to judge how the generated outfit would suit them. It would also have components for users to add their current wardrobe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This app would be great for those who are indecisive, or even children who are trying to develop a style and grow. A study conducted of 2000 men and women shows that it takes an average of 17 minutes for people to decide what outfit to choose from. Say you were to choose an outfit each day, having this app would eliminate almost 2 hours each week of outfit choosing. It would also be quite ideal for children who are beginning to learn to dress themselves, they could experiment with the app before putting on the clothes, or they can even generate their own outfits, which is a great solution for parents who can never dress their picky children. This allows children to learn to develop their own sense of style and allows them to have a sense of independence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This app would entail a lot of different features for people to replicate and enjoy the outfits that they create. I personally envision this app to be somewhat like an animated game, where people can input their physical features into the character, such as height, or body type. And unlike other ‘dress up’ applications, this app would allow users to choose the sizing of the outfits that they input into the game. This enables users to see how the size of the outfit would fit onto their body. For example, if I were to want to wear a size XS shirt in men’s, it would look a lot different on my body compared to wearing a XS in women’s. Having this customisation allows the user to know exactly how the clothing would fit on their body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An external feature that could also be added is the weather, it would be presented as a sort of widget on the app which allows users to tailor what the generator would generate based on what the weather is like.  </p>
                <p>
                  It would also be tailored for users with a specific outfit idea that they already have in mind, perhaps a monochrome look, they may be able to select the colour of clothing articles that is generated. Another added feature is something like a store, for the clothing items, while everything may be animated users are able to go to the store and search for other clothing items that they might like, click on it, which would bring them to a list of places where a similar item may be sold in real life. The user may also be able to semi customise the outfits, where they can lock in a specific item, such as a top that they may want to wear, and the app would generate all the other pieces of clothing around it, in order to complete the fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This app would also characterise different brands of clothing pieces inside the built-in store. Stores and other businesses could collaborate with this app, such as Nike, if they wanted to advertise their new clothing pieces, they may be able to add it into the store as well, allowing customers to try it on virtually onto their animated clone, and decide if it would match with the other clothing items that they may already have in their closet. And because of the in-depth customisation, users would know how the clothing item would personally fit on them, before online purchasing. This eliminates most of the online purchase fails, where people buy things online that end up not fitting them or not looking right.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for the game aspect, people can take internal photos of their characters and send them to their friends, being able to customise the background of their app as well to make it more personalised, or even customise the poses of their character, to give it more of a personality. Some apps that I might take inspiration from is Snapchat’s ‘Bitmoji’, except the app would allow users to see the full 3D render of their character. Maybe within the app, if it were to be advanced, it could have a feature where the app would determine the user’s animated character through a photo instead of having to manually type in all the features of the character.
                </p>
                <p>
                Software that may be used is animation software to generate the actual character, such as ‘room 8 studio’ which creates sculpted 3D characters. After creating these characters, they can be inputted into a gaming animation software, such as ‘unity’ to create movement of the character within the game. From this app, character animation can come to life, but also add ones and movements of clothing pieces may also be added to the program. Having each physical feature of the character such as hair and eyes separate from the actual body during the animation process would enable users to customise their character in any way they want, perhaps by swiping between different styles. All the outfits that are imputed would need to be added into a random generator as well, so that users are able to randomly generate their outfits. Also because of the added external feature of the weather app, that would also need to be included in some way, possibly an attachment through GITHUB, which would also be used to create the links for the incorporated stores inside of the app. A difficult part in achieving this is understanding mobile app development and putting all these features together to make them work. Future improvements to the app may include the possibility to generate the outfits in a certain style, such as minimal or chic.
                </p>
                <p>
                Skills that would be needed is the understanding of these animation software. This could be aided by someone in the design department, someone who is able to interact with animation software. But also integrating the animation into the app itself would be quite difficult. Hardware required would be a phone, to test and utilise the app itself. Another difficult aspect is how to incorporate a small store inside of the app without overwhelming the user with the amount of content that is already in there. Which is also a main issue, how to create an application like this that is easy to use for the users despite the number of features integrated into the app. So, a software to organise these into their intended categories would also be needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                If this project is successful, it would be able to create a more efficient way of dealing with clothes in the morning and save everyone a lot of time, whether its children or adults who need to decide what to wear. It would also create a way for others to shop more efficiently and prevent them from buying things online that may not fit or suit their body type. Overall eliminating a lot of waste of time and money. In conclusion, the outcome would be an outfit generator app, which can be interacted with like a game, making outfit picking both fun and time efficient!

                As an addition to this app to include everyone ideas, we have decided to incorporate the function of facial recognition, or more so figure recognition as an advancement of the application. Using tools such as _________. We have also collectively agreed on utilising chatterbots in order to effectively communicate with the user at their needs to implement the idea of a game and create a more fun way to generate one’s clothes. Perhaps even create a mascot to guide the user’s through the application, like ‘Qiqi’ in the game ‘Genshin Impact’. The chatterbox inputted can be presented as the mascot instead, again in order to communicate with the user’s in a more interactive way, which can answer questions such as what sex the user would want their character to be , instead of bombarding the user’s with a list of options of how they would want their character to appear which can create a more enjoyable process.

              <h3>JOHNSON</h3>
              <p>My ideal IT job is business analyst. The role of a business analyst is to review how a business operates creating greater efficiencies for the future of the business while also leading project teams and relaying their knowledge and technical understanding back to the business. This role first caught my eyes as it combined both IT and business creating a working environment that does not require me to be consistently staring at a screen for 8 hours a day and mixes both of my passions into one. My ideal job consists of communicating with people daily, leading my own team while also immersing myself in technology which delineates the role of a business analyst. </p>

              <h3>LISA</h3>
              <p>My personal ideal occupation is to become a ‘DevOps engineer’ also known as a development-operations engineer. It is from my understanding, an occupation which entails the engineer to merge and collaborate software development and IT operations to create more efficient and faster growth in the company’s software. The occupation itself currently has a high job growth rate of 30.0% which is predicted as of now until the next 5 years. It also has a median salary of 135K in Australia, which is quite significant, particularly for something with a job satisfaction rating of 4.1 out of 5. This career is something that I aim to reach as it incorporates many distinct aspects such as being able to understand and utilise different programming languages, but also requires you to interact with different departments, and working with different people. This is appealing to me as creating and dealing with technical competencies such as programming and scripting really spark my interest, but also because I love and enjoy communicating with others, which is also an especially important aspect of a DevOps engineer. Not only that, but by becoming a DevOps engineer I am able to branch off into other departments if I ever need a change in life. Perhaps return to the software development department or move back to IT operations. So, the flexibility of this job also intrigues me, as well as the abundance of growth that could be done in the industry.  </p>

              <p>In the future, I am inspired to pursue my job as an information technology analyst (also called cybersecurity analyst). With the job having a Median salary of $103,590, the individuals are tasked to protect a company’s computer networks and systems. The role of an information analyst is to design and implement security systems to protect a company or organisation's computer networks from cyber-attacks. The career caught my eyes as I was looking for a job with good pay as well as being able to do the job while being at any location. My ideal job is related to IT, having good pay and being able to not just work in an office. The salary is more than enough for me to enjoy my life and the job has a growth of 31% annually according to the job outlook. </p>

      <h2> What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group? </h2>
  <p>At the stem, our jobs are relatively similar as it requires our technical thinking of technology to communicate back to the company or business as of which we are employed by. The role of a business analyst is to review how a business operates creating greater efficiencies for the future of the business while also leading project teams and relaying their knowledge and technical understanding back to the business. Whereas a Development Engineer (DevOps) an occupation which entails the engineer to merge and collaborate software development and IT operations to create more efficient and faster growth in the company’s software. However, business analyst (BA) differ from a DevOps engineer as a business analyst requires one to review current technologies within a business and implement existing software or processes that may increase its efficiency. This requires a (BA) to consistently communicate with the company and their team to lead them efficiently and effectively. DevOps, however, are typically more independent in their work and it is their role to create new software from scratch. A cybersecurity analyst is like DevOps as they typically work independently and require greater levels of technical thinking than a BA. Their role is to ensure a business is protected from cyber-attacks and does not require them to increase the efficiency of the business like a DevOps engineer or a BA. </p>

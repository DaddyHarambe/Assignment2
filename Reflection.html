              <p>In general, our group project went relatively well. Although, we had a few hitches on our way to completion it is only normal that this occurred. In terms of work everyone did well. This group project only became difficult when we had to find everyone’s available times and set up a meeting. One thing that may have been significantly improved on is time management as a group. There were a few times where a meeting was delayed or work that was promised to be completed at a given time was not completed until a couple of days later. Although we held it together made sure everyone understood their tasks and still finished on time at a high degree. One thing that was surprising to me was how fast the last couple of weeks went. In my eyes much of this group project was a success and working with my fellow group members was an ease. One thing I have learned about working within this group is how effective and efficiently work can be done when everyone contributes and dedicate themselves to their part of the work. As long as there was a voice to guide the group anything is possible and in general not that complicated.

              <p>The group project for Assignment 2 went quite well. We were all able to cooperate with one another and complete our own sections relatively well. There were however a few difficulties with the meetings and planning a time which was suitable for everyone, because of everyone’s clashing timetables, but we were able to compromise and work around a few things to suit everyone’s needs. We all managed to complete all the parts that were allocated to us at the right time. I personally found it difficult to manage all my other subjects, but I found it a lot more manageable when the team divided the work onto certain days and assigning each part to be due at certain dates. The team was able to communicate with each other well, and had decent team chemistry. Overall, I found that there were more difficulties with the work more than the team itself, but I was able to get help through my groupmates and our meetings on call and text. </p>

              <p>Personally, this group project went well as we worked well as a team, and We were able to have a leader in our group to guide the group into the right direction and guide the rest of the team to completion. We were able to allocate everyone with jobs without any questions. Although we manage to pull it off just before due date. We had a few difficulties, but we were able to overcome. Setting up meetings with all the members became difficult as everyone had different schedules and free time to have the meeting. Through the meetings, it helped us get everything done and to fully know what needed to be done. This helped create a smoother ride to the end line. We all contributed and done our parts on time with all information which helped create the website with ease. With all of us having different personality types, it helped us by not having conflicting issues or ideas which made it more manageable for the team. The thing that surprised me was how quick we did this, as time went by so quick that I would forget what I was doing, but my teammates were able to help me stay on track.

      <h1>Goup's Thoughts</h1>
  <p>As a group everyone worked proficiently and effectively. Everything was done with a purpose and time was mostly spent well. Although was noted previously it was difficult to gather all group members to conduct a meeting has each group member had a constraint on a given day. Although, we got through this and managed to conduct a few group meetings. Johnson was able to contact an IT specialist to conduct for the interview. John also worked efficiently to complete the website. It is also thanks to Lisa for her project idea and contribution to the IT technology component of the assignment that we were all able to complete this assignment. One thing that could have been improved on as a group is being more committed to the work. There were times where the work felt difficult to begin and unmotivating to do. As a group we should have motivated each other to push through the struggles and worked together more in general. The group also agrees on how there was much to learn through this experience. One of the primary lessons we learnt as a group is that it is difficult for one person to solely work on a component of the assignment by themselves. When two people are not bouncing ideas between each other it becomes stagnant and difficult to generate ideas.  It was also critical that our group had a person to ensure who was doing what and relayed to the rest of the team what was required of them. It became distressful when each member did not know what to do during a given period. Another thing that went well during the group project was how willing each group member was to ask questions when confused or stuck on a situation. There was not a time where one of our members did not know what to do or understand a component of the assignment. Communication within the team was clear and everyone was comfortable with each other. All in all, working within a team has been a great experience for all of us. Everyone took responsibility for their actions at each critical moment of the assignment. There is still much to learn as our group is still new. Furthermore, another major lesson we can learn from and take from this experience is to always ensure everyone else is doing the right thing even if it’s a difficult decision and to check in on members from time to time and see how far they have gotten.
